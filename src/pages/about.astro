<h3>About</h3>
<p>The Time Lab is a next generation facility which builds on a long tradition of international leadership in
     both radiocarbon and tree-ring science at the University of Arizona. Housed in the <a href="https://ltrr.arizona.edu">Laboratory of Tree-Ring 
     Research</a>, where the scientific methods of dendrochronology were pioneered in the early 1900's, the TIME Lab 
     is equipped with a MICADAS radiocarbon dating system and laser ablation stable isotope facility. 
     Building on strong foundations of the UArizona Radiocarbon laboratory, established in 1954 and home to the 
     journal '<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/radiocarbon"><i>Radiocarbon</i></a>' since 1989, 
     new investment by both the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a> and the University 
     of Arizona has combined expertise in the two most accurate and widely used dating techniques for the last 
     40,000 years into a single state of the art facility. We aim to push the boundaries of what 
     can be achieved through high-resolution AMS and isotopic measurements of tree-rings;  synchronizing multi-proxy, 
     global scale chronologies; reconstructing past climate, solar forcing and shifts in Earth's systems. 
     The lab will link our past, present and future through carbon cycle studies and provide precise dates for a wide 
     range of carbon based samples.
